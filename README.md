# **E-commerce Churn Prediction Application**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to create a scalable and efficient solution for predicting customer churn in e-commerce businesses. By leveraging internal data from Shopify (such as customer interactions, purchase history, and abandoned carts) as well as external data sources, we build machine learning models to help businesses reduce churn rates. The application provides actionable insights that allow businesses to retain at-risk customers through targeted marketing and personalized support strategies.

## **Why is Churn Prediction Important?**

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. In e-commerce, understanding the reasons behind churn and being able to predict it in advance can make a significant difference in revenue. Retaining an existing customer is often far more cost-effective than acquiring a new one. By implementing this solution, e-commerce businesses can:

-   Identify customers who are likely to churn and engage with them before they leave.
-   Personalize retention strategies based on customer behaviors and interactions.
-   Optimize marketing campaigns and customer support for better retention.

## **Main Integration with Shopify**

This project is designed to integrate seamlessly with Shopify, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms. Shopify provides a comprehensive set of APIs that allow us to collect valuable data, such as:

-   **Purchase History**: Understanding customer buying patterns.
-   **Abandoned Carts**: Identifying when and why customers leave products in their carts without completing the purchase.
-   **Customer Interactions**: Analyzing interactions with support or website browsing behavior to detect frustration or dissatisfaction.

By connecting your Shopify store to this churn prediction application, you'll receive valuable insights and predictions on which customers are most at risk of leaving your business.

## **Features**

-   **Churn Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of customer churn.
-   **Data Collection**: Gathers customer data (purchase history, cart abandonment, interactions) from Shopify through their GraphQL API.
-   **Real-Time Dashboard**: Visualizes churn predictions, allowing you to take immediate action.
-   **Personalized Alerts**: Receive notifications or suggestions to engage with at-risk customers before they churn.

## **Tech Stack**

-   **Frontend**: Next.js (React) for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR).
-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express, using a Hexagonal Architecture to decouple business logic from external systems (Shopify, database, etc.).
-   **Data Layer**: Integration with GraphQL for flexible data querying from Shopify's API.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing customer and churn prediction data.
-   **Machine Learning**: Python (or AWS SageMaker) for creating and training the churn prediction model.
-   **Monitoring**: Datadog or similar tools for real-time performance monitoring.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the repository**

bash

Copier le code

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-churn-prediction.git
cd ecommerce-churn-prediction` 

### **2. Install dependencies**

bash

Copier le code

`npm install` 

### **3. Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

bash

Copier le code

`SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your-shopify-api-key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your-shopify-api-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url` 

### **4. Run the development server**

bash

Copier le code

`npm run dev` 

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the project in action.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Data Collection**

The application collects data from Shopify using their GraphQL API. This data includes customer interactions, purchase history, and abandoned carts.

### **2. Churn Prediction Algorithm**

Using the collected data, the churn prediction algorithm (built in Python or through AWS SageMaker) analyzes patterns and assigns a churn probability to each customer.

### **3. Insights and Actions**

The churn prediction data is displayed on a real-time dashboard where businesses can view key metrics, such as the likelihood of churn for each customer. From there, they can take action by offering personalized incentives, targeted marketing, or improved support.

## **Roadmap**

-   Build the initial integration with Shopify's GraphQL API.
-   Set up the data pipeline for collecting and storing customer data.
-   Implement the churn prediction algorithm using a machine learning model.
-   Develop the real-time dashboard for visualizing churn metrics.
-   Add email notifications and suggestions for customer retention strategies.
-   Expand to other e-commerce platforms (WooCommerce, BigCommerce).
